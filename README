ðŸ§¬ Compartmental Models in Epidemiology
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE) 

Explore and simulate classic epidemiological models like SIR using R. This repository provides practical examples and visualizations to aid understanding of disease dynamics.

ðŸ“‚ Contents

    `sir_practical.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the practical exercise.

    `sir_practical_solution.html`: Rendered HTML solution for the practical.

    `compartmental_models_epidemiology.pdf`: PDF version of the presentation covering theoretical aspects.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

    Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/stegostegosaur/compartmental-models-epidemiology.git`

    Open in RStudio: Open sir_practical.Rmd in RStudio to explore and run the simulations.

    View the Presentation: Open compartmental_models_epidemiology.pdf to review the theoretical background.

ðŸ“Š Preview

ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

    Understand the structure and assumptions of compartmental models.

    Simulate disease spread using R.

    Interpret the impact of parameters on disease dynamics.
